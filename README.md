### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm a graduate student with a humanities perspective on information science. Iâ€™m interested in building digital research environments to help us tell better stories about the past. Iâ€™m currently working on a research database for Shakespearean source materials. I'm interested in the intertexual connections between Mary Sidney's Psalms translations (1590s) and Shakespearean plays and poems.
