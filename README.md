### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a graduate student with a humanities perspective on information science. Iâ€™m interested in building digital research environments to help us tell better stories about the past. Iâ€™m currently working on a research database for Shakespearean source materials. I'm interested in the intertexual connections between Mary Sidney's Psalms translations (1590s) and Shakespearean plays and poems.

### A great metadata resource
is [The Getty Vocabulary](http://vocab.getty.edu), where supported vocabularies for art, architecture, geography, and artist names can be found, inclduing full instructions for Sparql queries to search these vast meta-datasets.

### Topics I love
include [Library Carpentry](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry), a hub of data-related tutorials to improve data use, analystics, and stewardship in library environments, and [The Programming Historian](https://github.com/programminghistorian), a peer-reviewed data science instructional platform for humanities research.
